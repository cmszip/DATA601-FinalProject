    "## I. Overview\n",
    "Baseball is a sport of numbers and statistics. Because of this, there are all sorts of measurements of what happened in a game, as well as team and specific player performance. Over the years, and made more popular by fantasy sports and books/movies such as <i>Moneyball</i>, statistics have gotten even better at determining the value of players. These advanced statistics are commonly referred to as sabermetrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "But what is the formula for a team's success? Obviously, it's winning, because a team must win in order to become championship contenders. And obviously, winning is accomplished by scoring more runs than your opponent. But if you were a general manager of a baseball franchise, you would want to go beyond that to determine a more precise equation to field a consistently winning team. Then, based on this formula, a general manager should be able to determine a player's value in terms of contributing to a team's winning chances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the problem above, this project focuses on answering the following questions:\n",
    "* What features most significantly impact the winning percentage of a given Major League Baseball (MLB) team?\n",
    "* For those given features, to what extent do they impact a team's winning percentage?\n",
    "* Based on this, who has been the most valuable player in contributing to a team's winning percentage from 2017-2020?\n",
    "    \n",
    "By answering these questions, a general manager can build a roster to maximize it's odds of winning. As such, a general manager could target particular players in free agency or through trades to acquire them. Furthermore, since spending in baseball is limited based on what a particular team can afford in its market, as well as a tax beyond a particular salary threshold, a general manager could use this formula to determine if a given player is an improvement over a player currently rostered at that position on the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background Work\n",
    "The book and movie <i>Moneyball</i> really brought sports analytics into the mainstream. As such, most of the work that can be found on Github and through Google uses a specific dataset to replicate the model built in the book. My approach will be different in that I will be using a different dataset to pull from more recent years and that the dataset will include advanced baseball statistics known as sabermetrics."

    "## II. Data Acquisition\n",
    "To answer the research questions above, this project requires both team statistics to determine the equation for winning and player statistics to determine who has contributed the most to winning. To acquire this data, the MLB statistic repository Fangraphs.com is used. This data is pulled specifically from the [database search engine found here](https://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=bat&lg=all&qual=y&type=8&season=2020&month=0&season1=2020&ind=0). Fangraphs collects data daily and updates with the most recent baseball statistics. As the 2020 baseball season has come to a close, this particular repository of team and individual statistics was most recently updated in October and will not be updated until the 2021 season begins (hopefully).\n",
    "\n",
    "To acquire the needed data, we need to run multiple requests, then export each of them. For the team stats, you click on the \"Team Stats\" panel, select multiple seasons, split them, hit submit, then export. Do this for the Batting, Pitching, and Fielding tabs. We split the seasons because a given team will vary in its performance--and its roster--from year to year, adding to our sample size. To build an adequate sample size, we will pull data for each season beginning in 2006. For the individual stats, you click on the \"Player Stats\" panel; because we are viewing individual players stats over the past few seasons, we will select \"Multiple Seasons\" from 2017 to 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the years selected for this sample seem arbitrary, they are not. Baseball is known to have time periods that stylize play, commonly known as eras. From the late 1980s into most of the 2000s, power hitting had a surprising jolt due to the prevalence of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs. Long-standing home run records were broken multiple times during this period. The 2006 season is when MLB began to test and discipline players for performance-enhancing drugs, and therefore is a good starting point for our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process can easily be repeated by others who wish to replicate or customize the data pulled for their own usage. The datasets for team batting, fielding, and pitching will also need to be combined. To see how to do that, please visit Notebook 1. Instead, this notebook will show you the resulting merged dataset.\n",

    "Because the goal of this project is to determine the factors which most contribute to winning in baseball, this is a supervised learning project. The target variable is an engineered feature called win percentage (W%). The columns that became important as part of the discussion of it included home runs (HR), batting average (AVG), on-base percentage (OBP), home runs allowed per nine innings (HR/9), batting average allowed on balls in play (BABIP_y), ground ball percentage (GB%), and home runs allowed per fly ball (HR/FB). For more information on each of these statistics, I strongly encourage you to view [Fangraph's glossary of baseball statistics](https://library.fangraphs.com/getting-started/)."

If you hit the ball well and get on base, you'll score more runs. We see a strong negative correlation between strike outs per 9 innings (K/9) with balls in zone (BIZ) and plays made (Plays). This also makes sense, as a team that strikes opposing batters out will have to field fewer balls hit by opposing batters.\n",

We see the strongest negative correlation with earned run average (ERA). This is also expected, because if you allow opposing teams to score fewer runs against you, you have a better chance of outscoring them for a win. This information will likely come in handy when we build our models, although they also may present multicollinearity problems.\n",

    "## VII. Conclusions, Interpretation, and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, we developed a model that will account for 58.1% of data variance with a low mean squared error of 0.002 while maintaining that all of its included features are statistically significant. Moreover, it uses seven features, so its cost to calculate is low.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should now return to our research questions to answer them:\n",
    "* What features most significantly impact the winning percentage of a given Major League Baseball (MLB) team?\n",
    "    * The features which most significantly impact winning percentage are home runs (HR), batting average (AVG), on-base percentage (OBP), home runs allowed per nine innings (HR/9), batting average allowed on balls in play (BABIP_y), ground ball percentage (GB%), and home runs allowed per fly ball (HR/FB).\n",
    "* For those given features, to what extent do they impact a team's winning percentage?\n",
    "    * From multiple linear regression models, the following formula was created:\n",
    "    <div align=\"center\"><i><b>W%</b> = 0.8092 + (0.1078 * HR) + (1.0229 * AVG) + (1.4072 * OBP) - (0.4279 * HR/9) - (2.0556 * BABIP_y) - (0.8026 * GB%) + (2.4894 * HR/FB)</i></div>\n",
    "* Based on this, who has been the most valuable player in contributing to a team's winning percentage from 2017-2020?\n",
    "    * It was calculated that Mike Trout contributed the most offensively toward his team's winning percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this information, a general manager can attempt to build a winning roster by signing or trading for players that will improve the team's statistics that impact winning percentage. It also means that conversely, the general manager can determine if particular players are harming the team's odds of winning. The general manager could also use this to find players at specific contract costs that will maximize the team's potential winning percentage at a given salary payroll. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "One limitation comes from baseball itself. We could only craft a model that accounted for 58.1% of data variance. There is a lot to baseball that impacts winning and losing. While you want your team to bat well, field well, and pitch well, no team is perfect. Players make mistakes in all phases of the game which can have a direct outcome on the result, especially in a close game. So this model cannot account for a higher amount of the data variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, one of the problems with sports predictions is that the rows are not truly independent of one another. The teams play each other, impacting each other's win percentages. For example, the Yankees will typically play the Orioles 19 times in a standard length season. Each time they play each other, they impact each other's win percentage. Thus, they aren't independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation is that the dataset of team statistics was only 450 rows. This was chosen as a precaution to prevent skewed data from the \"steroid era\" of baseball. But a larger dataset from multiple decades of seasons would be preferable. Additionally, a few features were removed due to many null values. Perhaps these features could have been important in determining the win percentage, but the decision was made to preserve as many rows/seasons as possible in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Thoughts\n",
    "These notebooks sought to develop a model to predict a Major League Baseball team's winning percentage based on the team's performance in particular areas (features). The model did this fairly well, but I was disappointed in it only covering 58.1% of the data variance. That being said, it seems on par or even outperforms similar models found through a search of Google. There is a model (coded in R) ([link here](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/466923_475fdd164e7343f88fa8b2df67d3b648.html#model-diagnostics)) that ended with a 0.426 R-squared value, and another multiple linear regression model ([link here](http://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/326635_edfcfb859221409eb4fcc8e8d564bb09.html)) that ended with a 0.93 R-squared value. What I noticed about the models with much higher R-squared values is that they approached the problem very differently. They saw that run differential has a high correlation with win percentage, and then used regression to target run differential. This approach was popularized by <i>Moneyball</i>, so most of the work I have found uses this approach. Another key difference is that I opted to include advanced baseball stats (known commonly as sabermetrics) in my dataset, which is uncommon. Surprisingly, the batting sabermetrics did not make it into the model, but the pitching sabermetrics did.\n",
    "\n",
    "All that being said, I would be interested in attempting this again through the <i>Moneyball</i> approach to see how my results would differ. Batter up.\n",
